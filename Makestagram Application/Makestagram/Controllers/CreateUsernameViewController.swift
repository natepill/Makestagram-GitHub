            //code was refactored
// First we guard to check that a FIRUser is logged in and that the user has provided a username in the text field.
// We create a dictionary to store the username the user has provided inside our database
// We specify a relative path for the location of where we want to store our data
// We write the data we want to store at the location we provided in step 3
// We read the user we just wrote to the database and create a user from the snapshot
 //Now whenever an user is created, a user JSON object will also be created for them within our database.
